{"question": "How can you avoid making your hemorrhoids worse?", "answer": "Bump up the fiber. It softens your stools and makes them move through your body more easily. You'll find it in beans, whole-grain breads and cereals, and fresh fruits and veggies. You may also want to try a supplement if you can't get enough from foods. Add fiber slowly to help avoid gas and bloating. Drink lots of fluids. Stay well hydrated to keep stools soft so they're easier to pass. Water is the best choice. Drink plenty throughout the day. Prune juice is a natural laxative and can help you go. Exercise regularly. Even brisk walking 20-30 minutes every day can help keep you from getting stopped up. Breathe! Keep the air moving in and out when you're working hard. It's common to hold your breath as you're pushing, pulling, or making an effort (you probably don't realize you're doing it) -- and that can lead to hemorrhoid pain and bleeding. Use a pillow. Sit on a cushion instead of a hard surface. It will ease swelling for any hemorrhoids you have. It may also help prevent new ones from forming. Take breaks.
