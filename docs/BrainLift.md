# BrainLift ðŸ“šâœ¨
*A living knowledge hub for how we "lifted" the codebase with AI workflows.*

## 1. Purpose
BrainLift collects every reference, tutorial, paper, or blog post that helped us design, implement, and improve the Pre-Examination Charting Agent.  
It keeps the whole team (and future contributors) up-to-speed on the rationale behind our AI choices and makes onboarding painless.
