- **Output**: Ranked diagnosis options with:
  - Condition name and ICD-10 code
  - Probability score (0-1)
  - Supporting evidence from transcript
  - Contradicting factors
  - Additional tests needed
  - Clinical reasoning

### Step 8: Treatment Recommendations
- **Evidence-Based**: Treatment options based on current medical guidelines

## AI Analysis Prompts

### Symptom Extraction Prompt
```
You are a medical AI assistant specializing in clinical symptom analysis. 

Analyze the following patient visit transcript and extract all symptoms mentioned by the patient. For each symptom, provide:

1. Symptom name (standardized medical terminology)
2. Severity (mild/moderate/severe) if mentioned
3. Duration (onset and how long present)
4. Frequency (constant, intermittent, specific timing)
5. Context (triggers, relieving factors, associated symptoms)
6. Source text (exact quote from transcript)
7. Confidence score (0.0-1.0) for accuracy of extraction

Format as structured JSON. Only extract symptoms explicitly mentioned by the patient.

Transcript: {transcript_text}
```

### Differential Diagnosis Prompt
```
You are an expert clinician providing differential diagnosis based on patient presentation.

Given the extracted symptoms and patient history below, generate a comprehensive differential diagnosis. For each potential diagnosis:

1. Condition name and ICD-10 code
2. Probability score (0.0-1.0) based on symptom fit
3. Supporting evidence from the case
4. Contradicting factors or missing symptoms
5. Additional tests/workup needed
6. Clinical reasoning (2-3 sentences)

Rank diagnoses by probability and include 5-8 most likely conditions.

Symptoms: {extracted_symptoms}
Patient History: {patient_history}
```

### Treatment Recommendations Prompt
```
You are a clinical decision support AI providing evidence-based treatment recommendations.

Based on the differential diagnosis and patient information, provide treatment recommendations for the most likely conditions. Include:

1. First-line treatments with evidence level
2. Alternative options and their indications
3. Contraindications based on patient history
4. Monitoring requirements
5. Follow-up timeline and specialist referrals
6. Patient education points

Consider patient allergies, current medications, and comorbidities.

Diagnosis: {primary_diagnosis}
Patient Allergies: {allergies}
Current Medications: {medications}
```

exports.analyzeTranscript = functions.https.onCall(async (data, context) => {
  // Authenticate user
  if (!context.auth) {
    throw new functions.https.HttpsError('unauthenticated', 'User must be authenticated');
  }
  
  const { visitId, transcriptText } = data;
  
  try {
    // Step 1: Extract symptoms
    const symptoms = await extractSymptoms(transcriptText);
    
    // Step 2: Parse medical history
    const history = await parseHistory(transcriptText);
    
    // Step 3: Generate differential diagnosis
    const diagnosis = await generateDifferential(symptoms, history);
    
    // Step 4: Treatment recommendations
    const treatments = await getTreatmentRecommendations(diagnosis, history);
    
    // Step 5: Risk assessment
    const riskFlags = await assessRisk(symptoms, diagnosis);
    
    // Save analysis results
    const analysis = {
      visitId,

        role: 'system',
        content: 'You are a medical AI assistant specializing in clinical symptom analysis...'
      },
      {
        role: 'user',
        content: `Transcript: ${transcript}`
      }
    ]
  });
  
  return JSON.parse(response.choices[0].message.content);
}
```

### Error Handling & Retry Logic
```javascript
const MAX_RETRIES = 3;
const RETRY_DELAY = 1000;

async function withRetry(operation, retries = MAX_RETRIES) {
  try {
    return await operation();
  } catch (error) {
    if (retries > 0 && isRetryableError(error)) {
      await sleep(RETRY_DELAY);
      return withRetry(operation, retries - 1);
    }
    throw error;
  }
}

function isRetryableError(error) {
  return error.code === 'rate_limit_exceeded' || 
         error.code === 'timeout' ||
         error.status === 503;
}
```
