## 🔄 Development Workflow

### **Feature Development Process**

#### 1. **Feature Planning**
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/[feature-name]

# Example:
git checkout -b feature/speech-to-text-integration
```

#### 2. **Development & Implementation**
- Develop the feature according to specifications
- Write comprehensive tests for new functionality
- Ensure code quality with linting and type checking
- Test feature thoroughly in development environment

#### 3. **Documentation Update (MANDATORY)**
When completing a feature, **ALWAYS** update the following documents:

##### A. **PRD Implementation Status** (`docs/PRD-Implementation-Status.md`)
```markdown
# Update the specific requirement status from:
| Requirement | Status | Implementation Notes |
|-------------|--------|---------------------|
| Speech-to-text processing | 📋 Planned | Audio processing pipeline designed |

# To:
| Requirement | Status | Implementation Notes |
|-------------|--------|---------------------|
| Speech-to-text processing | ✅ Complete | Implemented with Azure Cognitive Services |
```

##### B. **BrainLift Knowledge Base** (`docs/BrainLift.md`)
- Add any new technical resources or references used
- Update the implementation status section
- Add to changelog with version bump

##### C. **Main README** (`README.md`)
- Update feature status from "In Development" to "Live"
- Add new feature to capabilities list
- Update version number if it's a major feature

#### 4. **Commit & Push**
```bash
# Stage changes
git add .

# Commit with structured message
git commit -m "feat: [Feature Name]

- Implemented [specific functionality]
- Added [components/services/features]
- Updated PRD implementation status
- [Other relevant changes]

Closes #[issue-number]"

# Push feature branch
git push origin feature/[feature-name]
```

#### 5. **Pull Request & Documentation Review**
- Create PR with comprehensive description
- Include PRD compliance checklist in PR description
- Ensure all documentation is updated
- Request review from team

#### 6. **Post-Merge Documentation Sync**
```bash
# After merge, update main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Update version in package.json if major feature
npm version patch  # for bug fixes
npm version minor  # for new features  
npm version major  # for breaking changes
```

## 📊 PRD Tracking System

### **Monthly PRD Review Process**

#### **Week 1: Feature Completion Assessment**
1. Review all completed features from previous month
2. Update `PRD-Implementation-Status.md` completion percentages
3. Move completed items from "In Progress" to "Completed" 
4. Update overall completion percentage

#### **Week 2: Priority Roadmap Update**
1. Reassess priority levels based on business needs
2. Update timelines for planned features
3. Add newly identified requirements
4. Review and adjust resource allocation

#### **Week 3: Documentation Sync**
1. Ensure all docs reflect current implementation state
2. Update BrainLift.md with new resources and references
3. Sync README.md with latest capabilities
4. Review and update technical architecture diagrams

#### **Week 4: Planning & Forecasting**
1. Plan next month's development priorities
2. Update PRD roadmap with new timelines
3. Identify potential blockers or dependencies
4. Update success metrics and KPIs

### **Automated PRD Tracking Commands**

#### **Quick Status Check**
```bash
# Run this command to see PRD implementation overview
npm run prd:status

# This will display:
# - Overall completion percentage
# - Recently completed features
# - Next priority items
# - Documentation sync status
```

#### **Feature Completion Workflow**
```bash
# When completing a feature, run:
npm run feature:complete [feature-name]

# This will:
# 1. Prompt for PRD requirement mapping
# 2. Update implementation status
# 3. Generate documentation updates
# 4. Create commit with proper formatting
```

### **PRD Documentation Templates**

#### **Feature Completion Template**
```markdown
## ✅ [Feature Name] - Completed

**PRD Section:** [3.X.X - Requirement Name]  
**Completion Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]  
**Implementation:** [Brief description]  
**Status Change:** 📋 Planned → ✅ Complete

### Implementation Details:
- [Key component 1]
- [Key component 2] 
- [Integration points]

### PRD Compliance:
- ✅ [Specific requirement 1]
- ✅ [Specific requirement 2]
- ⚠️ [Partial requirement with notes]

### Next Steps:
- [Related features or improvements]
- [Integration opportunities]
```

#### **Monthly Review Template**
```markdown
## Monthly PRD Review - [Month YYYY]

### Completed This Month:
- ✅ [Feature 1] - [PRD Section]
- ✅ [Feature 2] - [PRD Section]

### In Progress:
- 🔄 [Feature 3] - [Expected completion]
- 🔄 [Feature 4] - [Current status]

### Updated Priorities:
- 🎯 [High priority item] - [Justification]
- 📋 [Moved to next quarter] - [Reason]

### Completion Status:
- **Overall:** [XX]% → [YY]% (+Z%)
- **Core Features:** [XX]% → [YY]%
- **Advanced Features:** [XX]% → [YY]%
- **Integration Features:** [XX]% → [YY]%
```

## 🤖 Automated Documentation Tools

### **Git Hooks for Documentation**

#### **Pre-commit Hook** (`.git/hooks/pre-commit`)
```bash
#!/bin/sh
# Check if PRD documentation is up to date

echo "Checking PRD documentation status..."

# Check if PRD-Implementation-Status.md was updated in this commit
if git diff --cached --name-only | grep -q "docs/PRD-Implementation-Status.md"; then
    echo "✅ PRD documentation updated"
else
    echo "⚠️  Consider updating PRD documentation if this includes new features"
fi
```

#### **Post-commit Hook** (`.git/hooks/post-commit`)
```bash
#!/bin/sh
# Auto-update documentation after commits

echo "Updating documentation timestamps..."

# Update last modified dates in documentation
sed -i "s/Last Updated: .*/Last Updated: $(date)/" docs/PRD-Implementation-Status.md
```

### **Documentation Validation Script**

#### **Run Documentation Sync Check**
```bash
# Create script: scripts/validate-docs.sh
#!/bin/bash

echo "🔍 Validating documentation sync..."

# Check if all completed features are documented
# Check if version numbers are consistent
# Validate PRD completion percentages
# Ensure all links are working

echo "✅ Documentation validation complete"
```

## 📈 Success Metrics Tracking

### **Documentation Health Metrics**
- **Documentation Coverage**: % of features with complete documentation
- **PRD Accuracy**: % of PRD items with current status
- **Update Frequency**: Average time between feature completion and doc update
- **Review Completion**: % of monthly PRD reviews completed on time

### **Development Velocity Metrics**
- **Feature Completion Rate**: Features completed per sprint/month
- **PRD Progress Rate**: % PRD completion increase per month
- **Documentation Debt**: Outstanding documentation updates needed
- **Process Compliance**: % of features following complete workflow

---

## 🎯 Best Practices

### **Documentation Standards**
1. **Always update PRD status immediately after feature completion**
2. **Use consistent status indicators**: ✅ Complete, 🔄 In Progress, 📋 Planned
3. **Include implementation notes with technical details**
4. **Update completion percentages at least monthly**
5. **Link related features and dependencies**

### **Commit Message Standards**
```bash
# Feature completion
feat: [feature-name] - [brief description]

# Documentation updates
docs: Update PRD status for [feature-name]

# Version updates  
chore: Bump version to v[X.Y.Z] - [major changes]

# Bug fixes affecting PRD status
fix: [issue] - update implementation status
```

### **Branch Naming**
- `feature/[feature-name]` - New features
- `docs/[update-type]` - Documentation updates
- `fix/[issue-name]` - Bug fixes
- `release/v[X.Y.Z]` - Release preparation

---

## 📞 Process Support

### **Team Responsibilities**
- **Developers**: Update PRD status when completing features
- **Tech Lead**: Review PRD accuracy during code reviews
- **Project Manager**: Conduct monthly PRD reviews
- **Documentation Lead**: Ensure consistency across all docs

### **Escalation Process**
1. **Documentation Inconsistency**: Report to Tech Lead
2. **PRD Status Disputes**: Escalate to Project Manager
3. **Process Improvements**: Submit to team for review
4. **Automation Issues**: Report to DevOps team

---

This workflow ensures that the PRD implementation status stays current and accurate, providing clear visibility into project progress and feature completion status.

**Remember**: Good documentation is as important as good code! 📚✨
