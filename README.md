# Visit Transcript Analysis & AI Diagnosis Assistance 🩺🤖  
AI-powered platform that analyzes patient visit transcripts to assist healthcare providers with diagnosis and treatment recommendations.

## 🎯 Current Status
**Phase:** Architecture & Frontend Planning  
**Stack Finalized:** React + TypeScript + Firebase + OpenAI GPT-4  
**Next:** Begin frontend development with visit transcript upload and AI analysis features  

## 1. Why It Matters
• Healthcare providers spend significant time analyzing patient visit recordings for diagnosis and treatment planning  
• Important symptoms and context can be missed during manual transcript review  
• Our AI assistant extracts key symptoms, suggests differential diagnoses, and provides treatment recommendations  
• Focus: Transform visit transcripts into actionable clinical insights while maintaining provider control

## 6. Data Model Overview
### Core Entities
- **Patients** – Basic demographics and medical history from conversations
- **Visits** – Visit records with transcripts and AI analysis
- **Visit Transcripts** – Audio/text processing with speaker identification
- **AI Analysis** – Symptom extraction, diagnosis suggestions, treatment recommendations
- **Visit Notes** – Generated documentation and provider notes
- **Users** – Healthcare providers with role-based access

### AI Analysis Components
- **Extracted Symptoms** – Identified symptoms with severity and context
- **Patient History** – Medications, allergies, conditions from transcript
- **Diagnosis Options** – Differential diagnosis with probability scores
